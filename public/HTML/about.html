      <h1> About me</h1>
      <p>
        My name is <strong>Ashtin Rivada</strong>. My favorite hobby is playing basketball and a close second would be playing video games. Over the summer I 
        was taking classes at north seattle, but when I was not in class I was either at UW's IMA playing basketball, hiking, or relaxing at home with my cats.
